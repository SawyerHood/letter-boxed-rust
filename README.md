# letter-boxed-rust
A brute force generator for 2 word combos for the NYT's letter-boxed game. Check out the game at https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed

## Why?

I was really curious how many different ways it would be possible to solve the letter boxed game with only two words and it would be some rust practice at the same time.

## How to run
* clone the repo
* `cargo run {letters seperated by spaces here}` like: `cargo run e m a h n l o i t b s r`
* wait for the results to come in
